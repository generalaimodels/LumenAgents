# üöÄ Advanced AI Assistant CLI  

## üß† Overview  
**Advanced AI Assistant CLI** is a powerful tool built using cutting-edge language models (LLMs). It provides a rich suite of features for interactive AI-driven tasks such as text generation, code generation, Linux interactions, API searches, and web search synthesis.

This project utilizes a modular architecture, allowing for seamless integration and scalability while enhancing usability through a command-line interface (CLI).

## ‚ú® Key Features  
- **Text Generation Pipeline:** Intelligent responses using contextual history.  
- **Code Generation & Execution:** Generate and execute Python code dynamically.  
- **Linux System Interaction:** Perform OS-level commands and operations.  
- **API Search Agent:** Search and process data from external APIs.  
- **Web Search & Synthesis:** Intelligent synthesis of web search results.  
- **Self-Prompting:** Generate fine-tuned prompts from user input.  
- **Command History Management:** View, export, and import command history.  

## üìÇ Project Structure  
- `history_manager.py`: Manages interaction history.  
- `Agent_tool.py`: Implements code generation, web search, and API search.  
- `rag_pipeline.py`: Handles retrieval-augmented generation tasks.  
- `main.py`: Main entry point for the interactive CLI.
